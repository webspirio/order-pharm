/**
 * LOCALLY EDITED shadcn primitive. Re-running `shadcn add badge` reverts the
 * two edits below, and both are contract, not taste — see docs/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md.
 *
 * 1. RADIUS. Two families and no third: `rounded-lg` (12px, `--radius`) for
 *    controls, `rounded-2xl` (24px, `--radius-card`) for surfaces. The registry
 *    ships four more — `rounded-md`, `rounded-xl`, `rounded-4xl` and a
 *    `min(var(--radius-md), 10px)` ladder — which is what made the intake read
 *    as a different site from the page around it.
 * 2. FOCUS. The registry pattern is `outline-none` plus a soft `ring-ring/50`
 *    halo. It is removed here so the site's single focus rule applies:
 *    `:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid var(--focus) }` in global.css, which
 *    is INK and flips to the signal colour on `.on-slab` / `.on-plate`. A ring
 *    token cannot follow that flip, and a 50%-opacity halo does not clear the
 *    3:1 that WCAG 2.4.11 asks of a focus indicator. `aria-invalid` keeps its
 *    destructive border and halo, which is what keeps an invalid control
 *    visually distinct from a focused one now that focus is not a ring.
